## Business Questions and Findings

### 1. Which product categories generate the highest total sales?
Electronics is the highest revenue-generating category.  
This suggests that prioritizing inventory availability and promotions in Electronics could significantly impact overall revenue.

### 2. How do sales vary by month?
Sales exhibit significant seasonal fluctuations:
The Peak: May is the strongest month by far, reaching $53,150.
Secondary Peaks: October ($46,580) and December ($44,690) also show strong performance, likely due to autumn shopping and the holiday season.
The Low Point: September is the weakest month of the year ($23,620), representing a sharp drop-off after the summer.

### 3. Are there differences in purchasing behavior by gender?
Female customers contribute a slightly higher share of total revenue compared to male customers.  
This insight can support more targeted marketing strategies and product positioning.

### 4. Which age groups contribute the most to revenue?
The 50+ age group generates the highest revenue at $52,965.  
While revenue remains relatively consistent across the 20–40 age range (approximately $48,000–$49,000), customers aged 40 and above represent the most valuable segments.
