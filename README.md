Business questions  
1) Which product categories generate the highest total sales?  
  Electronics is the highest revenue-generating category, contributing the largest share of total sales. This suggests that prioritizing inventory availability and promotions in Electronics could have a strong impact on overall revenue.

2) How do sales vary by month?  
  Sales show a steady upward trend from January to April, indicating increasing customer demand over time. This trend could help the business plan inventory and staffing more effectively during higher-demand months.

3) Are there differences in purchasing patterns by gender?  
  Female customers contribute a slightly higher share of total revenue compared to male customers. This insight can help tailor marketing strategies and product offerings toward the more active customer segment.

4) Which age groups contribute the most to revenue?  
  Revenue is highest among the 50-year-old demographic ($\$52,965$). While sales are fairly consistent across the 20–40 age range (averaging around $\$48,000–\$49,000$ per group), the 50+ and 40+ segments are currently your most valuable customers in terms of total spend.

5) What insights could help improve sales or customer experience?    
    A. Capitalizing on the "May Peak" & "September Slump"  
       Insight: There is a massive revenue gap between your best month (May) and your worst (September).  
       Action : Analyze what drove the May success (e.g., a specific promotion or seasonal launch) and replicate it. For September, consider a "Back-to-Business" or "End of Summer" clearance event to bridge the revenue gap.
  
    B. Target the "Silver Spenders" (Age 50+)
        Insight: The 50-year-old age group is your highest-spending segment.  
        Action : Ensure your marketing imagery and product selection reflect this demographic. Tailored loyalty programs or premium service offerings for this group could further increase their lifetime value.
  
    C. Electronic & Clothing Synergy
        Insight: These two categories are neck-and-neck for the top spot.
        Action : Experiment with "Lifestyle Bundling." For example, marketing wearable tech (Electronics) alongside fitness apparel (Clothing) to capture sales from both leading categories simultaneously.
  
    D. Gender-Neutral Marketing Strategy
        Insight: With a nearly 50/50 split in spending between genders, your brand has successfully achieved "unisex" appeal.
        Action : Avoid overly gendered marketing that might alienate half your audience. Instead, focus on interest-based segmentation (e.g., tech enthusiasts, fashion-forward shoppers) to maximize reach.

    E. Customer Experience Improvement  
        Insight: Since Beauty lags slightly behind, this may be an area for "experiential" growth.
        Action : Consider adding virtual try-on tools or detailed video tutorials for Beauty products to boost confidence and conversion in this category to match the performance of Electronics and Clothing.
